Dashboard
		- The 'Budget' widget doesn't pull through the correct budget. The budget quotes is ~4x what it should be. I think it's probably pulling in income categories.
		- The recent transactions is empty - it should be scrollable and show the last 3 days of transactions
		
Transactions
		- Transaction upload - text pointing to quick add button for manual transactions which doesn't exist
		- Need an Import/Upload button on this page - currently only doable through the quick add menu
		- Just some transaction table UI improvements - i.e.e alignment of table headings and content, $ signs for transactions
		- A transaction flagged as for review does not show up in the Family Review tab
        - Subscriptions to be its own page rather than a tab within transactions

Subscriptions
		- The Edit Subscription box should appear directly below the subscription being edited (currently at the top of the page)
		- The Edit Subscription box 'Amount' field should round to 2 decimals
		- The Edit Subscription box 'Budget Category' field should automatically populate with the transaction's category
		- Need logic for detecting recurring inflows for shared subscriptions (family spotify plan is a $24 outflow with two $8 inflows)
		- Monthly cost and annual projection should account for the fact that some are inflows and some are outflows - currently classifies all as outflows.

Budget
		- Changing the time filter should also change the budgets in the budget cards to match the timeframe (changing timeframe to 'Last Year' measures all of last years spend agains the monthly budget)
		- Changing the member filter should also change the budgets in the budget cards to match the member's budget (currently showing the full budget)
		- Budget cards are not correctly categorizing subcategories in to Non-Discretionary and Discretionary. Some parent categories (e.g. Food) have some discretionary subcategories (e.g. dining out) and some non-discretionary subcategories (e.g. groceries). This should be reflected in the budget cards.
		
Settings
		- Account Settings - 'Member Since Unknown' - fix this
