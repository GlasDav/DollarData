## Next Session Recommendations

### Option 1: Continue Production Readiness (20% remaining)
**Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Tasks**:
- Write auth flow tests
- Transaction component tests
- Budget CRUD tests
- API documentation examples
- Deployment guides

**Result**: 90-95% production ready

### Option 2: Return to Feature Development
**Recommended**: Build features while infrastructure is solid

From [Feature Roadmap.md](file:///c:/Users/David%20Glasser/OneDrive/Documents/Projects/Principal/Feature%20Roadmap.md):
- Phase 7: Tax Optimization Tools
- Phase 10: Enhanced Analytics & Forecasting

### Option 3: Deploy to Staging
**Tasks**:
- Set up staging environment
- Deploy using Docker
- Invite beta testers
- Gather feedback

---

## Questions to Consider Next Session

1. Deploy to staging for real-world testing?
